# Auditory-Ace

An open-source app using Godot to help people practice their hearing skills.

Auditory Ace is an app designed for people of all ages who use a Cochlear Implant and was originally designed by the Deviant Developerâ€™s Dream Capstone Team at Portland State University during the Fall 2023 / Winter 2024 capstone. The app serves as a specialized platform, offering users a unique opportunity to hone their auditory skills by practicing sound recognition through their implants. With a user-centric approach, Auditory Ace provides a diverse range of sound exercises, encompassing simple tones and everyday sounds. The app's inception within the academic environment showcases the team's commitment to leveraging technology for positive impact, as it empowers Cochlear Implant users to engage in targeted practice sessions, fostering a richer and more nuanced auditory experience.
